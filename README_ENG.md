## What does SDWEAK offer?
- Increased **minimum**, **average**, and **maximum FPS**
- Improved **smoothness**, **response**, and **frame time**
- Reduction in the number of **stutters** and **microfreezes**
- More stable performance when RAM is low
- Improving **process planning**
- Overall improvement in system responsiveness and gaming experience

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Performance gains vary depending on the specific game.

## Optional features

> The optimal configuration is used by default.
> Some features are only available on Steam Deck LCD and will not be available on Steam Deck OLED.
> Some features are only available on SteamOS 3.7 and will not be available on SteamOS 3.8.

- **Fixes uneven frame rates when using FPS limiting via QAM. Only for SteamOS 3.7 and LCD (BETA)**  
  Eliminates micro-freezes and frame rate spikes caused by FPS limiting via QAM (Steam side menu).

- **Overclocking the screen to 70 Hz. (LCD)**  
  Increases the screen refresh rate to 70Hz. Useful for limiting 35FPS(70Hz) and for using the 70FPS(70Hz) limit in undemanding projects.

- **Optimized Linux kernel. Only for SteamOS 3.7**  
  Includes many improvements:

- Disabling overhead in the configuration (including disabling mitigation)
- Adding THP Shrinker
- And a number of less significant but useful changes

- **CPU power efficiency priority. Only for SteamOS 3.7 (BETA)**
Sets the minimum frequency priority for the CPU without losing FPS.
Improves battery life, but single stutters are possible.

> It is recommended to **disable** this for heavy AAA games.  
> Can be enabled for AA and light games.
> Requires an **optimized kernel**.

- **GPU driver optimization**
Adjusts GPU driver settings.
Improves performance and GPU process scheduling.
